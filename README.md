Netflix Titles Data Analysis

### Description

This project analyzes Netflix's content library to uncover trends in movies and TV shows. Using Python, I explored the dataset to identify patterns such as the top regions producing content, the distribution of content types, and rating frequencies, demonstrating my skills in data analysis and visualization.

### Dataset

The dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) includes 8,807 Netflix titles with details like type (Movie/TV Show), country, release year, rating, and genres. Itâ€™s sourced from Kaggle and provides a rich foundation for analyzing Netflix's content trends.

### Analysis

I used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to:
- Identify the top regions with the most titles (e.g., United States: 3,690 titles, India: 1,046 titles).
- Explore the distribution of movies vs. TV shows and trends over time (e.g., release years).
